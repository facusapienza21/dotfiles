# On macOS - New iTerm windows/tabs run this file, but NOT .barhrc
# On JupyterHub - new terminals do NOT run this file, only .bashrc

# Note that the traditional Unix design idea was to have a user's session
# contain a _single_ login shell, with all one-time actions taken there, and
# all subsequent interactive shells started as child processes of that one,
# thus inheriting its setup. Those interactive shells would then only load
# .bashrc. However, OSX starts each new terminal as a login shell, and
# JupyterLab terminals are also login shells. So it makes sense to configure
# this file to load .bashrc directly, and put most user configuration logic
# into .bashrc.
